Bubble column: edited main case with Ua = 0.6m/s
Column height: 0.5m, 200 cells.
da = 3mm, Ua = 0.6m/s.
No obstacle.
Solver: bubbleFoam.

In order to run this demo:

1. Make sure you are using OpenFOAM v.2.0.1 (e.g. run OF201).
   The groovyBC is also required.
2. Run "./Allclean", if needed.
3. Run "./Allrun" or "./Allparrun".
The parallel execution is configured for two subdomains.

If you are using an old version of Paraview, uncomment the "reconstructPar"
command in the Allrun/Allparrun scripts. Otherwise, you can load the decomposed
case in Paraview.

This is the full-scale case and it requires several hours of computations.
Feel free to interrupt the computations early.

In case you want to run a shorter column, you must change the files:
1. blockMeshDict
2. setFields
3. refine.setSet
